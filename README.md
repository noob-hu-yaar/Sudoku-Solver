#GENERAL STEPS-
1. Here I have created a very simple Sudoku Solving code, which uses the concept of Recursion and Backtracking to fill the vacant spaces of the sudoku.
2. I have used C++11 language for the same.
3. Just download the file and run it on any online or offline IDE that supports C++11 or above, and voila !!!.....your sudoku is all set to get its answer.
4. It is suggested that if any online IDE is used for the purpose  of running the code, one with a terminal is preferred.
(https://repl.it/languages/cpp11 is one of my personal favourites.You can get the required answer in this IDE.)
5. Regarding input format-
   items of the same row can be separated by a space and press the enter button once a row has been entered.
